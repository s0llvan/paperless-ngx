## Proposed change

This PR transitions to Docker image away from supervisord to use [s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/overview.html), as provided by [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay).

### What

s6 is a process supervision suite of tools, and s6-overlay is a nice implementation wrapping them up into useful settings for Docker use. It's the same set of tools used by the [LinuxServer.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/how-is-container-formed) team for their base images.

The previous 2 bash scripts have been broken apart into distinct oneshot services handling a single thing, with dependencies as required. For the most part, start up ordering is identical. I've included a flowchart in the folder of how the startup dependencies are setup.

### Why

In the [second paragraph](http://supervisord.org/) of the `supervisord` documentation, it is noted to not be a proper replacement for PID 1. s6 is a proper PID 1 process supervision suite with some nice utilities for process control as well. It's good to have a proper [PID 1](https://daveiscoding.com/why-do-you-need-an-init-process-inside-your-docker-container-pid-1) for signal handling, clean shutdowns and reaping zombies properly.

All the s6 services, oneshot or longrun can have dependencies defined between them, ensuring and enforcing a valid ordering of startup. This includes more correct handling of optional services like `flower`, which previously was kind of hacky and just allowed to exit, even if it should have started.
